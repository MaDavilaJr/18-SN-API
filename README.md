# Social Network API

## Description

This week's project was to create the backend of a social network API using noSQL. We used MongoDB to store data, MongoDB is known for its flexible technological application and provides advantages over MySQL, of which we avoided using particularly for this assignment. In this application we can store users and their emails; Users can store thoguhts and then other users can react to those thoughts. There is also a friend function within the application that allows users to create a friendship to one another.
