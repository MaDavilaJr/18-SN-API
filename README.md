# Social Network API

## Description

This week's project was to create the backend of a social network API using noSQL. We used MongoDB to store data, MongoDB is known for its flexible technological application and provides advantages over MySQL, of which we avoided using particularly for this assignment. In this application we can store users and their emails; Users can store thoguhts and then other users can react to those thoughts. There is also a friend function within the application that allows users to create a friendship to one another.

## Installation

Run 'npm install' in the command line to install all the necessary dependencies if trying to run the app locally. 

## Usage

To access this application download the code and run 'npm start' in the root of the directory. THen open insomnia and follow the route paths in the routes directory to store data in the database.

### Contributing

**User**:

* `username`
  * String
  * Unique
  * Required
  * Trimmed

* `email`
  * String
  * Required
  * Unique
  * Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

* `thoughts`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

* `friends`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `friendCount` that retrieves the length of the user's `friends` array field on query.

---

**Thought**:

* `thoughtText`
  * String
  * Required
  * Must be between 1 and 280 characters

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

* `username` (The user that created this thought)
  * String
  * Required

* `reactions` (These are like replies)
  * Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `reactionCount` that retrieves the length of the thought's `reactions` array field on query.

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

* `reactionId`
  * Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  * Default value is set to a new ObjectId

* `reactionBody`
  * String
  * Required
  * 280 character maximum

* `username`
  * String
  * Required

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

**Schema Settings**:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.

### API Routes

**`/api/users`**

* `GET` all users

* `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

* `POST` a new user:

```json
// example data
{
  "username": "lernantino",
  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

**BONUS**: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**

* `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list

* `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---

**`/api/thoughts`**

* `GET` to get all thoughts

* `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`

* `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)

```json
// example data
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
  "username": "lernantino",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

---

**`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`**

* `POST` to create a reaction stored in a single thought's `reactions` array field

* `DELETE` to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's `reactionId` value

## Grading Requirements

This homework is graded based on the following criteria:

### Deliverables: 10%

* Your GitHub repository containing your application code.

### Walkthrough Video: 37%

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the social media API must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.

  * The walkthrough video must show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to start the application’s server.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users and thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

  * Walkthrough video must demonstrate POST and DELETE routes for a user’s friend list being tested in Insomnia.
